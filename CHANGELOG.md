## Changelog

## v0.1.0 - 9 Feb 2019
   * Initial release with support for:
      * players
      * league
      * freeAgents
      * rosters
      * salaryAdjustments

## v0.2.0 - 12 Feb 2019
   * Added support for all exports that are not league-specific, except:
     * siteNews (an rss feed for MyFantasyLeague news)
     * rss (an rss feed of various league data)

The remaining requests are low-priority given that the 
best way to consume them is to simply call the request
directly and consume the output in an RSS reader.

## v0.3.0 - TBD
   * Add support for remaining exports that are league-specific
